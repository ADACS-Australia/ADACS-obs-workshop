# CIC Machine Learning Workshop

This repository contains lecture notes and Juypter notebooks for the [Curtin Institute for Computation (CIC)](http://computation.curtin.edu.au) - *Introduction to Machine Learning* workshop run at the Curtin University in Perth, Australia.

The workshop materials have been prepared by:
- [Kevin Chai](http://computation.curtin.edu.au/about/computational-specialists/health-sciences/)
- [Rebecca Lange](http://computation.curtin.edu.au/about/computational-specialists/humanities/)

## Workshop

A basic knowledge of python is assumed for this workshop. i.e. knowledge of basic data structures, operations and how to write a script. The notebooks have been developed to be compatible with Python 2.7x and 3.x and, may require some Python packages to be updated to the most recent version (e.g. scikit-learn).

The dataset used in this workshop is compiled from [Galaxy Zoo DR1](https://www.galaxyzoo.org/) and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) ([using the DR9 SQL search](http://skyserver.sdss.org/dr9/en/tools/search/sql.asp)).

The notebooks are descriptive and comprehensive enough to be attempted at your own pace - a solution notebook is also provided. The lecture notes explain the intuition behind how different machine learning algorithms work.
