    "## Introduction to Python and data analysis using pandas\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language. This means the code is easy to read for humans and there is no need for us to compile it and in many cases we do not have to think too much about the underlying system fro e.g. memory usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a consequence, we can use it in two ways:\n",
    "- Using the interpreter as an \"advanced calculator\" in interactive mode:\n",
    "- Executing programs/scripts saved as a text file, usually with *.py extension:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Recap: quick intro to python\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data types\n",
    "How information is stored in a DataFrame or a python object affects what we can do with it and the outputs of calculations as well. There are two main types of data that we're explore in this lesson: numeric and character types.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Numeric Data Types**\n",
    "\n",
    "- integer\n",
    "- float\n",
    "\n",
    "**Character Data Types**\n",
    "\n",
    "- strings (a word, a sentence, or several sentences)\n",
    "- strings that contain numbers can not be used for mathematical operations!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Lists** \n",
    "\n",
    "are a common data structure to hold an ordered sequence of\n",
    "elements. Each element can be accessed by an index.  Note that Python\n",
    "indexes start with 0 instead of 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tuple**  \n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to a list in that it's an ordered sequence of elements. However,\n",
    "tuples can not be changed once created (they are \"immutable\"). Tuples are\n",
    "created by placing comma-separated values inside parentheses `()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dictionary** \n",
    "\n",
    "A container that holds pairs of objects - keys and values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dictionaries work a lot like lists - except that you index them with *keys*. \n",
    "You can think about a key as a name for or a unique identifier for a set of values\n",
    "in the dictionary. Keys can only have particular types - they have to be \n",
    "\"hashable\". Strings and numeric types are acceptable, but lists aren't.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Operators\n",
    "We can perform mathematical calculations in Python using the basic operators\n",
    " `+, -, /, *, %`:\n",
    " \n",
    "** In python 2 if we divide one integer by another, we get an integer! **\n",
    "The result in python 3 is different where we get a float.\n",
    "Remember to convert your integers to floats when you want floating point precision for divisions!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also use comparison and logic operators:\n",
    "`<, >, ==, !=, <=, >=` and statements of identity such as\n",
    "`and, or, not`. The data type returned by this is \n",
    "called a _boolean_.\n",
    " \n",
    "### Scripting\n",
    "\n",
    " **Comments** start with #\n",
    " \n",
    " **Methods** are a way to interact with an object (a list, for example). We can invoke \n",
    "a method using the dot `.` followed by the method name and a list of arguments in parentheses. \n",
    "To find out what methods are available for an object, we can use the built-in `help` command:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Library** in Python contains a set of tools (called functions) that perform\n",
    "tasks on our data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Python doesn't load all of the libraries available to it by default. We have to\n",
    "add an `import` statement to our code in order to use library functions. To import\n",
    "a library, we use the syntax `import libraryName`. If we want to give the\n",
    "library a nickname to shorten the command, we can add `as nickNameHere`. \n",
    "\n",
    "You only need to load a library once during your session. You can load the library when needed\n",
    "or you can load all necessary libraries at the beginning of your script. \n",
    "This is good practice, especially for the readability of your code"

    "## Starting in the same spot\n",
    "\n",
    "To help the lesson run smoothly, let's ensure everyone is in the same directory.\n",
    "This should help us avoid path and file name issues. At this time please\n",
    "navigate to the workshop directory. If you working in IPython Notebook be sure\n",
    "that you start your notebook in the workshop directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "A quick aside that there are Python libraries like [OS\n",
    "Library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html) that can work with our\n",

    "## Pandas in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the best options for working with tabular data in Python is to use the\n",
    "[Python Data Analysis Library](http://pandas.pydata.org/) (a.k.a. Pandas). The\n",
    "Pandas library provides data structures, produces high quality plots with\n",
    "[matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/) and integrates nicely with other libraries\n",
    "that use [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/) (which is another Python library) arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each time we call a function that's in a library, we use the syntax\n",
    "`LibraryName.FunctionName`. Adding the library name with a `.` before the\n",
    "function name tells Python where to find the function. In the example above, we\n",
    "have imported Pandas as `pd`. This means we don't have to type out `pandas` each\n",
