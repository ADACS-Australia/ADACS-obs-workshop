    "# Types of Data\n",
    "\n",
    "How information is stored in a DataFrame or a python object affects what we can do with it and the outputs of calculations as well. There are two main types of data that we're explore in this lesson: numeric and character types.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Numeric Data Types\n",
    "\n",
    "Numeric data types include integers and floats. A **floating point** (known as a\n",
    "float) number has decimal points even if that decimal point value is 0. For\n",
    "example: 1.13, 2.0 1234.345. If we have a column that contains both integers and\n",
    "floating point numbers, Pandas will assign the entire column to the float data\n",
    "type so the decimal points are not lost. In a vector or data fram (we learn about these different types later) the entire object or an entire column will be of the same type.\n",
    "\n",
    "An **integer** will never have a decimal point. Thus 1.13 would be stored as 1.\n",
    "1234.345 is stored as 1234. You will often see the data type `Int64` in python\n",
    "which stands for 64 bit integer. The 64 simply refers to the memory allocated to\n",
    "store data in each cell which effectively relates to how many digits it can\n",

    "## Character Data Types\n",
    "\n",
    "Strings are values that contain numbers and / or characters. \n",
    "For example, a string might be a word, a sentence, or several sentences. \n",
    "A string can also contain or consist of numbers. For instance, '1234' could be stored as a\n",
